# Module_3 Challenge - Crypto Arbitrage

"This is a python command-line interface application that allows users to see qualifying loans from lenders quickly and easily. The application works by taking in a `daily_rate_sheet` of loan criteria from various loan providers, asking the user a number of questions to evaluate their loan eligibility, and then returning to them a list of qualifying loans." 

The preceding quote was taken from the solution for an earlier exercise.  The `daily_rate_sheet` will be in CSV format.  The main criteria for determining loan eligibility will be the loan applicant's credit score and debt-to-income ratio, plus the size of the loan as well as the loan-to-home_value ratio.

This application has been updated from the original to allow the user the option to create an output file and, if so, name the output file themselves.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.9.7 with the following packages:

* [fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) - For the command line interface, help page, and entrypoint.

* [questionary](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary) - For interactive user prompts and dialogs

The preceding lines were taken from the solution for an earlier exercise, edited only to reflect a slightly newer version of Python being employed.

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```python
  pip install fire
  pip install questionary
```

## Usage

To use the loan qualifier application simply clone the repository and run the **app.py** with:

```python
python app.py
```

Upon launching the loan qualifier application you will be greeted with the following prompts:

![Loan Qualifier Prompts](images/app_user_input_screenshot.png)

If there are no qualifying loans available to the user, the screen will look similar to this:

![Loan Qualifier Prompts](images/app_user_input_screenshot_3.png)

If there are qualifying loans, the screen will look either like this, if an output file is chosen by the user:

![Loan Qualifier Prompts](images/app_user_input_screenshot_2.png)

...or like this, if no output file was selected:

![Loan Qualifier Prompts](images/app_user_input_screenshot_4.png)
